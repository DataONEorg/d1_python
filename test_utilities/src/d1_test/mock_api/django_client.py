"""Mock Requests to issue requests through the Django test client.

Django includes a test framework with a test client that provides an interface that's
similar to that of an HTTP client, but calls Django internals directly. The client
enables testing of most functionality of a Django app without actually starting the app
as a network service.

For testing GMN's D1 REST interfaces, we want to issue the test requests via the D1 MN
client. Without going through the D1 MN client, we would have to reimplement much of
what the client does, related to formatting and parsing D1 REST requests.

This module is typically used in tests running under django.test.TestCase and requires
an active Django context, such as the one provided by `./manage.py test`.

Usage:

import d1_test.mock_api.django_client as mock_django_client

@responses.activate
def test_1000(self):
  mock_django_client.add_callback(MOCK_MN_BASE_URL)
  d1_client = d1_client.mnclient_2_0.MemberNodeClient_2_0(MOCK_MN_BASE_URL)
  node_pyxb = d1_client.getCapabilities()

Note: for get(), GMN returns a StreamingHttpResponse that Requests detects as a
streaming response and handles accordingly. However, when returning a
StreamingHttpResponse from Responses, no special handling occurs. This breaks
test code that converts streams to strings by accessing .content (production
code should not do this since it causes the entire stream to be buffered in
memory). So we convert streaming responses to string before passing them to
Responses.

    # match is not found, the client turns the MultipartEncoder into its string
    # repr, that is used for debugging, and passes that on as the body.
    # MultipartEncoder generates a unique boundary value for the Content-Type each
    # time a multipart document is created, and there's no clean way to pass in
    # the hard coded string, that the Django test client expects, through
    # d1_client. So the buggy function in the Django test client is disabled here.

GMN returned (not raised) an object of an unexpected type. Often this is a
DataONEException or native Python exception. A HTTPResponse or one of its
subclasses was expected.

GMN returns DataONEException based types by design, but something in the
combination of the Django test client and the Responses library ends up fumbling
things up so that we don't get the chance to handle them.

DataONEException types may or may not indicate actual bugs.

Other types are likely to be one of Python's native exceptions, based on
Exception. They probably indicate real bugs.

The type/class name of the received instance is probably in this string:
