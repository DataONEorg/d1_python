    <abstract>
      <para>This data package consists of Daily Water Sample Nutrient Data for North Inlet
                Estuary, South Carolina, from 1978 to 1992, North Inlet LTER. Its purpose is to
                establish a long term data base on the nutrient dynamics of a salt marsh estuarine
                system. This data can be used in correlation with a number of other estuarine data
                sets to obtain a broader definition of the over all estuarine ecosystem.</para>

        <title>LTER Network Data Access Requirements</title>
        <para> The access to all LTER data is subject to requirements set forth by this
                    policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in
                    the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use.
                    These requirements are standardized across the LTER Network to provide
                    contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data
                    Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged
                    between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal
                    once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be
                    required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: <itemizedlist>

        <geographicDescription>North Inlet encompasses about 2,630 hectares of tidal marshes
                    and wetlands near Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. North Inlet-Winyah Bay
                    features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet,
                    contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary
                    is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural,
                    municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields and canals provide
                    another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the
                    confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located
                    along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank
                    Creek. Town Creek water samples -- 33.19'38" Lat., 79.10'0" Long. Clambank Creek

          <para> Known Nutrient parameters are entered into a "Raw Nutrient Run Book" for
                        every tray of samples that are run. This book contains parameters, and
                        pertinent notes associated with each tray. The following parameters are in
                        the "Raw Nutrient Run Book": Tray Number Chemistry Std. Cup.# Std. Cal.#
                        Dummy Std. Conc. Sample Chem.# (sample ID) Drift Dilution This book is
                        basically a NOTE book for the chemist running the samples. When a tray is
                        run, raw peak height numbers are written onto the ticker tape or printout,
                        which is kept in the chemistry lab. This data is hand copied into a "Master
                        Nutrient Raw Peak Height Book". ** NOTE ** (There is no re-editing of the
                        data that is written into the "Master Nutrient Raw Peak Height Book".) The
                        ticker tape and "Raw Nutrient Run Book" are kept in the fire proof cabinet
                        at the Baruch Marine Lab, Georgetown, SC. A "Nutrient Parameter Book" and
                        the "Master Nurtient Raw Peak Height Book" are kept in the chemistry lab at
                        the Baruch Marine Lab, Georgetown SC. The following data is in the "Nutrient
                        Parameter Book": Tray# Average Peak Height of standard Cups Oxidizer Reagent
                        Blank Drift Standard Concentration This book is necessary to run the
                        correction programs. At this point, a Data Manager entered the information
                        from the "Master Nutrient Raw Peak Height Book" into a CMS file. This data,
                        once entered was verified for typographical errors by the Data Manager.

          <geographicDescription>North Inlet encompasses about 2,630 hectares of tidal marshes
                  and wetlands near Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. North Inlet-Winyah Bay
                  features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet,
                  contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary
                  is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural,
                  municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields and canals provide
                  another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the
                  confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located

              <para> The Daily Water Sample program was started in 1978 to moniter the
                                daily nutrient cycling within the North Inlet Estuary System. The
                                original sampling site was at Town Creek. Later samples were taken
                                at Clambank and Oyster Landing as well. Samples were taken 365 days
                                a year at the same time every day, approximately 10:00 AM EST. The
                                samples were filtered at the Lab to separate the particulates from
                                the water. The filtered water was then run through a colorimeter and
                                the nutrient value peak heights derived were recorded on a ticker
                                tape type printout. These values were recorded into a master
                                nutrient note book, and entered onto a CMS file by the Data
                                Management Department at the lab. The filters that were used in the
                                filtering process were first weighted, burnt off and cleaned, then
                                they were weighted with the particulates dried onto them. These
                                filters were then cooked again for 24 hours at 450 degrees. This was
                                done to determine the inorganic particulates that were left. All
                                data files have since been stored on a SUN workstation and backed up
                                on 8mm tapes at both the field lab and the data management office at
                                the University of South Carolina.</para>

                                (1973), which was a modification of the Murphy and Riley (1962)
                                single solution method. The method depended on the formation of a
                                phospomolybdate blue complex, the color of which is read at a
                                wavelength of 880 mm.</para>

              <para>For this automated procedure for sulfate (Technicon Industrial
                                Method No. 118-71W/B), the sample was first passed through a
                                cation-exchange column to remove interferences. The sample
                                containing sulfate was then reacted with barium chloride at a pH of
                                2.5-3.0 to form barium sulfate. Excess barium reacted with
                                methylthmol blue to form a blue-colored was gray; if it was all
                                chelated with barium, the color was blue. Initially, the barium
                                chloride and methylthymol blue were equimolar and equivalent to the
                                highest concentration of sulfate ion expected; thus the amount of
                                uncomplexed methylthymol blue, measured at 460 mm, was equal to the
                                sulfate present.</para>

              <para>The basic method was Technicon Industrial Method No. 158-71W/B,
                                which utilized the reaction in which nitrate was reduced to nitrite
                                by a copper- cadmium reductor column. The nitrite ion then reacted
                                with sulfanilamide under acidic conditions to form a diazo compound.
                                This compound then coupled with N-1-napthylethylenediamine
                                dihydrochloride to form a reddish-purple azo dye.</para>

              <para>The basic method was Technicon Industrial Method No. 99-70W/B.
                                This automated procedure for the determination of chloride depended
                                upon the the liberation of thiocyanate ion from mercuric thiocyanate
                                by the formation of unionized but soluble mercuric chloride. In the
                                presence of ferric ion, the liberated thiocyanate formed a highly
                                colored ferric thiocyanate proportional to the original chloride
                                concentration.</para>

            <section>
              <title>Ammonia</title>
              <para>This method was from "The Automated Analysis of Nutrients in
                                Seawater: A Manual of Techniques" by Gilbert and Loder (1977), a
                                Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution publication No. WHO-77-47. This
                                method was dependent upon the Berthelot Reaction, during which the
                                formation of a blue colored compound closely related to indophenol
                                occurred when the solution of an ammonium salt was added to sodium
                                phenoxide, followed by the addition of sodium hypochlorite. A
                                solution of potassium sodium tartrate and sodium citrate was added
                                to the sample stream to eliminate the precipitation of the
                                hydroxides of calcium and magnesium. Total Nitrogen - Total
                                Phosphorus The procedure consisted of an alkaline persulfate
                                oxidation followed by automated analysis for nitrogen (as nitrate)
                                and phosphorus (as phosphate) on a Technicon Auto Analyzer. With
                                alkaline persulfate digestion, all nitrogen in the sample was
                                oxidized to nitrate, which was then reduced by cadmium and analyzed
                                as nitrite. The precision and recovery of this method compared
                                favorably with a Kjeldahl procedure (D'Elia et al., 1977). The main
                                advantage of the persulfate oxidation was the speed and convenience
                                with which it was accomplished. Unlike the Kjeldahl method, which
                                recovered only organic and NH4 - nitrogen, the persulfate oxidation
                                also included NO3 and NO2 nitrogen. The procedure described by
                                D'Elia (1977) has been so the digest could be analyzed using an
                                autoanalyzer (Gilbert et al., 1977). This semi- automated procedure
                                combined the persulfate oxidation with automated nitrate and
                                phosphate analysis to provide simultaneous analysis for total
                                persulfate nitrogen (TPN) and total persulfate phosphorus (TPP).
                                Gilbert's procedure was further modified to use a smaller sample
                                size so that the digestion flask could double as the sampler tray
                                cup (Loder, 1978). Using this method, many samples could be run
                                quickly with a minimum of handling. Carbon (prior to September 1989)
                                Particulate Carbon 20 ml of daily water sample was filtered through
                                a precombusted (24 hr @ 450 C) Whatman GFF 0.7 micron glass filter.
                                The filter was waved over concentrated HCl to eliminate inorganic
                                carbon, then placed in a precombusted ampule and frozen. Batches
                                were dried at 60 C for 48 hrs. 0.1 gr of precombusted (48 hr @ 750
                                C) reagent grade CuO was added to each ampule, the ampule was then
                                purged with pure oxygen and sealed, using an Oceanigraphics
                                International Purging and Sealing Unit #524PS. Ampules were etched,
                                then heated to 580 C for 4 hrs. Sorted ampules were then analyzed on
                                an Oceanigraphics International #524C TOC Analyzer by comparing
                                infrared absorption peak heights (Horiba PIR 2000) on an LDC strip
                                chart recorder with those of KHP (Potassium Hydrogen Phthalate)
                                standards. Standards were prepared by microsyringing a series of
                                volumes of a KHP solution into ampules and processing them as
                                samples. Reagent blanks were subtracted and average concentration of
                                duplicate samples was calculated for each DWS site. Dissolved
                                Organic Carbon The daily water sample was filtered through a
                                precombusted (24 hr @ 450 C) Whatman GFF 0.7 micron glass filter. An
                                aliquot of filtrate was refrigerated. Samples were purged of
                                inorganic carbon by adding 25percent phosphoric acid to lower the pH
                                to 2 and bubbling for 10 minutes with pure oxygen. The pH was then
                                neutralized using ammonium hydroxide to protect the oxidizing
                                catalyst. Every 5 minutes, using a Hamilton CR-700-200 spring loaded
                                syringe, a 100 microliter sample was injected into a Beckman 915A
                                TOC Analyzer and infrared absorption peak heights were compared to
                                those of KHP standard solutions to calculate carbon concentration.
                                Carbon (after September 1989) Dissolved Organic Carbon Water samples
                                were filtered through a precombusted Whatman GFF 7.0 micron glass
                                filter. Samples were purged of inorganic carbon by adding 10 percent
                                HCl and sparged with ultra zero grade air. A 40 microliter aliquot
                                was injected, via a autosampler, into a Shimadzu TOC-500 organic
                                carbon analyzer. A non-dispersive infrared gas analyzer was utilized
                                to measure the carbon dioxide produced and samples were run in
                                triplicate with means reported. ***NOTE*** A Whatman GFF 7.0 micron
