        "abstract": "The Remote Sensing Phenology (RSP) collection is a set of nine annual phenological metrics for the conterminous United States.  Researchers at the USGS EROS Center utilize data gathered by satellite sensors to track seasonal changes in vegetation.  The satellite sensors that provide the raw data are the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) carried aboard National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terra and Aqua satellites.  The satellite data are initially transformed into Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values.  eMODIS NDVI provide the foundation for the phenology metrics.  Time-series NDVI can be summarized and analyzed to produce nine key phenological indicators.  These data represent a powerful tool for documenting plant life-cycle trends and detecting the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.\nThe complete set of phenological metrics are as follows: 1. Start of Season Time (SOST): starting time of the onset of the growing season (in day of the year). 2. Start of Season NDVI (SOSN): NDVI value at the starting time of the onset of the growing season (unitless- based on NDVI units). 3. End of Season Time (EOST): ending time of the growing season (in day of the year). 4. End of Season NDVI (EOSN): NDVI value at the ending time of the growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 5. Maximum Time (MAXT): the day of the year when the NDVI reaches its maximum during the growing season (in day of the year). 6. Maximum NDVI (MAXN): the highest (or peak) value in NDVI observed in a growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 7. Duration (DUR): the length of the growing season-the time between the start of season and end of season (in number of days). 8. Amplitude (AMP): the difference between the Maximum NDVI and NDVI at the day of start of season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 9. Time Integrated NDVI (TIN): the cumulative value of NDVI from the start to the end of the growing season (unitless-based on accumulated NDVI unit",

The coverage of the data is global (-180\u00ba, 180\u00ba, -90\u00ba, 90\u00ba) with the underlying DEM being a hybrid of three datasets: HydroSHEDS (Hydrological data and maps based on SHuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales), Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). For most of the globe south of 60\u00ba North, the raster resolution of the data is 3-arc-seconds, corresponding to the resolution of the SRTM. For the areas North of 60\u00ba, the resolution is 7.5-arc-seconds (the smallest resolution of the GMTED2010 dataset) except for Greenland, where the resolution is 30-arc-seconds.

        "abstract": "Data provided from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) including simulated values of 72 hydrologic metrics, or indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA), 37 fish metrics, and 64 benthic invertebrate metrics were reviewed to assess significant flow-ecology relations that may be developed. Hydrologic alteration was represented by simulation of streamflow record for a pre-water-withdrawal condition (baseline) without dams or developed land, compared to the simulated recent-flow condition (2008) including withdrawals, dams and altered landscape to calculate a percent-alteration of flow.  Biological samples used represent a median condition of the biological community from 1972 to 2010.    This study reviewed more than 7,272 linear regression models that relate altered flow conditions to biological sample metrics in Virginia.  Decreasing flow conditions were the focus of this evaluation because of their relevance to the water-supply permitting process. The data tables highlight relations which may be significant and useful in future study and were further explored in the companion report; and relations that do not meet basic assumptions for valid linear regressions which were noted and omitted from the companion report. The three regions in Virginia defined by major drainage and physiographic boundaries as the Ohio River Drainages, Atlantic non-Coastal Plain, and Atlantic Coastal Plain were evaluated as well as a statewide grouping for fish and benthic data.     This extensive dataset provided the opportunity for hypothesis testing and prioritization of flow-ecology relations that have the potential to explain the effect(s) hydrologic alteration has on biological metrics in Virginia.",
