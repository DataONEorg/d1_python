"""Verify that Wheel package includes the exact set of files tracked by Git.

Arguments are the path to a setup.py file and a Wheel package built by it. The
directory tree below the location of the setup.py file is searched for tracked
files and then the Wheel file is checked to ensure it contains exactly those
files.

This is a workaround for the way setuptools works, which is basically that it
vacuums up everything that looks like a Python script in anything that looks
like a package, which makes it easy to publish local "junk" files by accident.

Notes: I'm pretty sure that setuptools cannot be made to exclude non-tracked
files out of the box. I found a plugin, setuptools_git, which I thought would
do the job, but it only makes sure that that all tracked files are included,
not that un-tracked files are not included. Still, what it does has some
benefits, so we use it for all the packages in d1_python.
