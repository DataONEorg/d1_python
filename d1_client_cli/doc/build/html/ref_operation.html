<h1>Overview of operation<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The DataONE Command Line Interface enables basic interactions with the DataONE
infrastructure via the command line.</p>
<div class="section" id="session">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Session<a class="headerlink" href="#session" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CLI is built around the concept of session variables. Session variables are
analogous to environment variables in an operating system. The session variables
store information that is often reused by multiple commands and minimize the
amount of typing that is required. For instance, one session variable is the
Base URL to a Member Node. Whenever a command is typed that will access a Member
Node, the URL for the Member Node is pulled from the session.</p>
<p>The session can be saved and loaded from files. This allows easy switching
between different roles by the user. For instance, if a user often works with
two different Member Nodes and creates different types of objects on them, he
can save the session after setting it up for each role, after which he can
easily switch between them by loading the appropriate session.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="read-vs-write-operations">
<span id="read-write-operations"></span><h2>Read vs. write operations<a class="headerlink" href="#read-vs-write-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The commands that cause operations to be issued against Coordinating Nodes and
Member Nodes are divided into two broad categories; read commands and write
commands. These two categories are handled differently by the CLI. Read
operations are issued immediately and their results displayed on screen or saved
to a file. Write operations, however, are added to a queue, called the write
operation queue, to be issued later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="write-operation-queue">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Write operation queue<a class="headerlink" href="#write-operation-queue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The DataONE infrastructure does not allow science objects to be modified or
deleted once created. Objects can be updated, but the original object stays in
the system forever. The write operation queue allows operations to be viewed and
edited, thus adding a buffer where mistakes, such as typos, can be caught
before the permanent operations are issued.</p>
<p>Like read commands, write commands use session variables. Each time an
operation is added to the write operation queue, the relevant session variables
are used for creating parameters for the operation. When an operation is later
issued, it uses the parameters stored in the operation, not the current session
variables.</p>
<p>When the commands have been verified, the queue is issued with a single command,
after which each of the operations in the queue are automatically performed in
sequence. If any operation fails, the process is stopped. The failed operation
and all subsequent operations remain in the queue and can be manipulated before
the queue is issued again. The successfully performed operations cannot be
undone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access-policy">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Access Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#access-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Access Policy is a list of subjects and their associated access levels. The
Access Policy is applied to new objects as they are created. The Access Policy
can also be updated on existing Science Data Objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="replication-policy">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>Replication Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#replication-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Replication Policy contains a list of Member Nodes that are specifically
preferred or blocked as replication targets. The Replication Policy also
contains a setting that specifies if replication is allowed or disallowed, and
the preferred number of replicas.</p>
<p>The Replication Policy is applied to new objects as they are created. The
Replication Policy can also be updated on existing Science Data Objects.</p>
<p>The DataONE infrastructure will never replicate an object to a Member Node that
is in the list of blocked Member Nodes for that object. If a Member Node is
added to the list of blocked Member Nodes after an object has been replicated to
that Member Node, the DataONE infrastructure will request that the Member Node
in question remove its copy of the object.</p>
<p>If the preferred number of replicas is larger than the number of Member Nodes
that have been specified as preferred replication targets, additional Member
Nodes that are not in the blocked list will automatically be selected as
replication targets.</p>
<p>If the preferred number of replicas is modified on an existing Science Data
Object, DataONE will adjust the number of existing replicas by creating and
deleting replicas of that object as needed.</p>
