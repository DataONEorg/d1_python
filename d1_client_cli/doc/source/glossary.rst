  DataONE Node
    :term:`CN` or :term:`MN`.


  MN
    DataONE Member Node.


  CN
    DataONE Coordinating Node.


  PID
    DataONE Persistent Identifier


  Science Data Object
    An object (file) that contains scienctific observational data.

    An object (file) that contains information about a Science Data Object
    object.

  Certificate
    A public key certificate (also known as a digital certificate or identity
    certificate) is an electronic document which uses a digital signature to bind
    a public key with an identity -- information such as the name of a person or an
    organization, their address, and so forth. The certificate can be used to
    verify that a public key belongs to an individual.

  Client Side Authentication
    :term:`SSL` Client Side Authentication is part of the :term:`SSL handshake`,
    where the client proves its identity to the web server by providing a
    :term:`certificate` to the server. The certificate provided by the client
    must be signed by a :term:`CA` that is trusted by the server. Client Side
    Authentication is not a required part of the handshake. The server can be
    set up to not allow Client Side Authentication, to require it or to let it
    be optional.


  Server Side Authentication
    :term:`SSL` Server Side Authentication is part of the :term:`SSL handshake`,
    where the server proves its identity to the client by providing a
    :term:`certificate` to the client. The certificate provided by the server
    must be signed by a :term:`CA` that is trusted by the client. Server Side
    Authentication is a required part of the handshake.


  Client side certificate
    :term:`Certificate` that is provided by the client during :term:`client side
    authentication`.

  SSL
    Secure Sockets Layer

    A protocol for transmitting private information via the Internet. SSL uses a
    cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt data âˆ’ a public key known
    to everyone and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the
    message.


  SSL handshake
    The initial negotiation between two machines that communicate over SSL.

  CA
    Certificate Authority

    A certificate authority is an entity that issues digital :term:`certificate`
    s. The digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the
    named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to
    rely upon signatures or assertions made by the private key that corresponds
    to the public key that is certified. In this model of trust relationships, a
    CA is a trusted third party that is trusted by both the subject (owner) of
    the certificate and the party relying upon the certificate. CAs are
    characteristic of many public key infrastructure (PKI) schemes.
