The :doc:`/d1_util/index` package contains command line utilities for interacting with the DataONE infrastructure.

The utilities are implemented using the DataONE :doc:`Common </d1_common/index>` and :doc:`Client </d1_client/index>` libraries for Python. Effort has been put into keeping the implementations clear and easy to read, allowing the utilities to also serve as examples on how to use the DataONE Python libraries.

After setup, all the utilities will be in the search path for the shell, so can be started from any directory. If using a virtual environment, the virtual environment must be active for the commands to work.
