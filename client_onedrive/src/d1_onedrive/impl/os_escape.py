"""OS specific escaping.

Escape DataONE identifiers, so that they follow the filesystem conventions and
restrictions for valid file- and folder names on a given OS.

Unescape the escaped file- and folder names to arrive at the original DataONE
identifiers.

DataONE supports identifiers containing characters that cannot (or should not)
be represented directly within the file- and folder names in a filesystem, such
as the path separator character ("/" on *nix). This module contains functions
for converting between DataONE identifiers and names that are suitable for use
as file- and folder names on the operating systems that are supported by
ONEDrive.

It is necessary to be able to get the original DataONE identifier given an
escaped name, so the escaping must be reversible. This is because the filesystem
driver (e.g., FUSE), passes the escaped name back to ONEDrive when the user
interacts with the file or folder.

The current implementation simply uses URL percent-encoding of an utf-8 encoding
of the Unicode strings.

Quote and unquote are somewhat borrowed from python urllib standard library.
