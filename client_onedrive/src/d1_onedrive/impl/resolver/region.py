README_TXT = u"""Region Folder

This folder provides a geographically ordered view of science data objects
for which the geographical area being covered is known to DataONE. Objects with
unknown geographical coverage do not appear in this folder.

The earth is divided into countries. Within the countries, there are various
administrative areas that differ in organization from country to country. There
can be several layers of administrative areas. For instance, in the US, there
are states and within the states, there are counties.

The Region folder arranges the science objects into folders that represent these
administrative areas. In a given level of the Region tree, all the science
objects that contain data for that administrative area will appear. Lower level
folders do not contain more science objects. They simply contain the same
science objects as in the current level, only arranged into smaller
administrative areas.

For instance, if the current object_tree folder contains two objects, one that has
data for California and Arizona and another that has data for Arizona and New
Mexico, both objects will appear under United States and under Arizona. But only
the first object will appear under California and only the second will appear
under New Mexico.
