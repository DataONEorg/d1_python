Clients
=======

The client classes wrap all the DataONE API methods, hiding the many details
related to interacting with the DataONE API, such as creating MIME multipart
messages, encoding parameters into URLs and handling Unicode.

The clients allow the developer to communicate with nodes by calling native
Python methods which take and return native Python objects.

The clients also convert any errors received from the nodes into native
exceptions, enabling clients to use Pythonâ€™s concise exception handling system
to handle errors.

The clients are arranged into the following class hierarchy:

.. graphviz::

  digraph G {
    dpi = 72;
    edge [dir = back];

    "REST Client\n(In D1 Common)" -> DataONEBaseClient

    DataONEBaseClient -> DataONEBaseClient_1_1 [weight=1000];
    DataONEBaseClient -> MemberNodeClient;
    DataONEBaseClient -> CoordinatingNodeClient;

    DataONEBaseClient_1_1 -> MemberNodeClient_1_1;
    DataONEBaseClient_1_1 -> CoordinatingNodeClient_1_1;

    MemberNodeClient -> MemberNodeClient_1_1;
    CoordinatingNodeClient -> CoordinatingNodeClient_1_1;

    MemberNodeClient -> DataONEBaseClient_1_1 [style=invis];
    CoordinatingNodeClient -> DataONEBaseClient_1_1 [style=invis];

    DataONEBaseClient_1_1 -> DataONEBaseClient_2_0 [weight=1000];
    MemberNodeClient_1_1 -> DataONEBaseClient_2_0 [style=invis];
    CoordinatingNodeClient_1_1 -> DataONEBaseClient_2_0 [style=invis];

    DataONEBaseClient_2_0 -> MemberNodeClient_2_0;
    DataONEBaseClient_2_0 -> CoordinatingNodeClient_2_0;

    MemberNodeClient_1_1 -> MemberNodeClient_2_0;
    CoordinatingNodeClient_1_1 -> CoordinatingNodeClient_2_0;

    MemberNodeClient_2_0 -> DataONEClient;
    CoordinatingNodeClient_2_0 -> DataONEClient;
  }

The classes without version designators implement functionality defined in v1.0
of the DataONE service specifications. The classes with version designators
implement support for the corresponding DataONE service specifications.

DataONEBaseClient

  The DataONEBaseClient classes contain methods that allow access to APIs
  that are common to Coordinating Nodes and Member Nodes.

  * :ref:`d1_client_d1baseclient`
  * :ref:`d1_client_d1baseclient_1_1`
  * :ref:`d1_client_d1baseclient_2_0`

MemberNodeClient

  The MemberNodeClient classes contain methods that allow access to APIs that
  are specific to Member Nodes.

  * :ref:`d1_client_mnclient`
  * :ref:`d1_client_mnclient_1_1`
  * :ref:`d1_client_mnclient_2_0`

CoordinatingNodeClient

  The CoordinatingNodeClient classes contain methods that allow access to APIs
  that are specific to Coordinating Nodes.

  * :ref:`d1_client_cnclient`
  * :ref:`d1_client_cnclient_1_1`
  * :ref:`d1_client_cnclient_2_0`

DataONEClient

  The DataONEClient uses CN- and MN clients to perform high level operations
  against the DataONE infrastructure.

  * :ref:`d1_client_d1client`

DataONEObject

  Wraps a single DataONE Science Object and adds functionality such as resolve
  and get.

  * :ref:`d1_client_d1client`

SolrConnection

  Provides functionality for working with DataONE's Solr index, which powers the
  ONEMercury science data search engine.

  * :ref:`d1_client_solr_client`
