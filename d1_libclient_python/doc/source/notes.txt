Miscellaneous Notes
===================

A few features that should be supported:

:Authentication:
  Need a pluggable authentication mechanism for testing, but likely to be
  replaced by a single mechanism once established.


:Caching:
  Intelligent support of caching both on the server and as part of the client
  tools working with the system will improve efficiency.


:HTTP Byte Range Requests:
  Enables a client to retrieve a portion of the target which can be useful for
  some types of data such as a simple array of values on the server.
  

:Stream Output:
  The responses from servers can be large, so the ideal response is a stream
  that is read by the client application as necessary.  However, this can 
  conflict with other types of operation such as caching, so best approach
  might be to support both types of response.  Fully read response by default
  and stream response when specifically requested by the client (e.g. when
  performing a D1 get() operation.


:Compressed Response:
  HTTP 1.1 supports compressed responses using zip ('deflate') or gzip ('gzip').  
  The client library should support decompression of response, passing on either
  a stream that performs decompression while reading or a blob of bytes that 
  have been decompressed depending on the requested response type.
