DataONE Python Products
=======================

DataONE provides a number of products implemented in Python and Java, as part of the :term:`Investigator Toolkit (ITK)`. Potential users of these products include software developers, Member Node partners and end users. Only the Python products are outlined in this document.

For software developers, DataONE provides development libraries implemented in Python. These provide functionality commonly needed by projects that interact with the DataONE infrastructure. It is recommended that applications implemented in Python use the libraries instead of interacting directly with the infrastructure as this is likely to reduce the development effort.

For Member Node partners, DataONE provides a Member Node (MN) implemented in Python, called Generic Member Node (GMN).

Lastly, DataONE provides various tools intended for end users, also implemented in Python. These include ONEDrive and the DataONE Command Line Client.
