DataONE Python Products
=======================

DataONE provides a number of products implemented in Python and Java, as part of
the :term:`Investigator Toolkit (ITK)`. Potential users of these products
include software developers, Member Node partners and end users. Only the Python
products are outlined in this document.

For software developers, DataONE provides development libraries implemented in
Python. These provide functionality commonly needed by projects that interact
with the DataONE infrastructure. It is recommended that applications implemented
in Python use the libraries instead of interacting directly with the
infrastructure as this is likely to reduce the development effort.

For Member Node partners, DataONE provides a Member Node (MN) implemented in
Python, called Generic Member Node (GMN).

Lastly, DataONE provides various tools intended for end users, also implemented
in Python. These include ONEDrive and the DataONE Command Line Client.
