# Exclude various files and directories from coverage.

# Only tracked files or directories need to be excluded here, as those are the
# only ones that get pushed to GitHub and pulled in by Travis. However, we also
# exclude some untracked directories that otherwise may significantly skew
# coverage locally.
#
# Don't filter /build/ here. A parent in Travis' default build directory has
# that name.
