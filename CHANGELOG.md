## [2.4.0](https://github.com/DataONEorg/d1_python/tree/2.4.0) (2017-11-16)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DataONEorg/d1_python/compare/2.3.8...2.4.0)

* DataONE Generic Member Node (GMN)
  * Fix ServiceFailure caused by some `listObjects()` and `getLogRecords()` slice requests
  * Fix datetimes in DataONE types sometimes returned as naive instead of in the UTC timezone
  * Add support for returning BagIt zip archives from `getPackage()`
    * BagIt objects are generated directly as streams, so arbitrarily sized BagIt archives can be requested and latency is the same as for regular `get()`  
  * Reverse the ordering of `ObjectList` (`listObjects()`) and `Log` (`getLogRecords()`)
    * Now ordered by modified timestamp, ascending, then identifier, ascending
  * Add limit to the maximum number of items that can be returned in a single slice
    * Adjustable via new `MAX_SLICE_ITEMS` setting, 5000 by default
  * Add fallback to default settings
    * Allows new settings to be added without requiring admins to add the new settings into their local settings.py after GMN upgrade
  * Add support for API calls without HTTP User Agent header in GMN
    * Such calls may be generated by custom, "one-off" clients
  * Fixes related to `create()` and `update()` of resource maps and their aggregated objects
    * "block" and "open" modes implemented as described in `RESOURCE_MAP_CREATE` in `settings_template.py`
    * Allow multiple Resource Maps to aggregate the same PID and each other
    * Allow Resource Maps to aggregate non-local and possibly non-existing objects
  * Rework internal representation and handling of revision chains
  * Update bulk importer for handling of out-of-order revisions
  * Refactoring
    * Split up input validation related functionality

    * These abstract away the details of the types and provide for concise and intuitive code
    * We plan on implementing such wrappers for all relevant types
  * Add new subpackage for generators
    * string generator
    * file contents generator
  * Add module for generating and validating BagIt streams
  * Add utilities for basic XML parsing
  * Improve utilities for comparing and normalizing XML
  * New date-time functions to better handle timezones

* Tests and test framework
  * Add around 300 tests since 2.3.8.
  * Add support for running tests in parallel with `pytest.xdist`
    * Run of test set, currently around 1100 tests, reduced from 7 to 2 min on dev machine
    * Each worker runs against a separate copy of the GMN database, instantiated from shared template
  * Add context managers for setting the CRUD whitelist
  * Add module that calls DataONE APIs in GMN without using PyXB
    * Gives the ability to generate and check response to invalid requests, such as requests with incorrectly formatted URLs, multipart documents, and DataONE types

    * Default is to not skip
  * Speed up slice tests

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DataONEorg/d1_python/compare/2.3.5...2.3.6)

* DataONE Generic Member Node (GMN)
  * Add extended listObjects() API
      * Fast method for retrieving large number of selected sysmeta values
      * Returns JSON

  * Add support for proxied objects in bulk importer
  * Add support for rejecting replication requests for non-public objects
  * Add Proxy, Obsoletes, ObsoletedBy and SeriesId to the custom headers returned by most D1 API methods

## [2.3.5](https://github.com/DataONEorg/d1_python/tree/2.3.5) (2017-08-08)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DataONEorg/d1_python/compare/2.3.4...2.3.5)

* DataONE Generic Member Node (GMN)
  * Add general bulk importer management command
    * Allows upgrading from any earlier version of GMN or other MN stack
  * Add cleardb diag management command
    * Remove cleardb from the diags page
    * Start code for other "diag" management commands
  * Improve the way that chains are represented in the db
    * Less code and faster SID related queries
  * Update revision change related model name
    * After earlier modifications in how the chains are represented, the old names were misleading
  * Add SID filtering support
      * Add support for passing SID as the getLogRecords() idFilter and listObjects() identifier args
      * Note: We don't resolve SIDs for v1, so the v1 pidFilter argument cannot take a SID.
      * Add tests for SID filtering
  * Fix bug: Unable to run management commands
  * Update node registration doc to reflects updated manage.py commands

* DataONE Client Library
  * Add support for v2 CNRead.synchronize()
  * Expose a ".total" attribute in iterators
    * Clients can read the value from .total to keep track of progress. Earlier, clients had to perform a separate query using filter parameters matching those used by the iterator. There was also a potential race, in that the total could change between query by the iterator and by the client.
  * Change iterator arguments:
    * ObjectListIterator: listObjects_args_dict -> list_objects_args
    * LogRecordIterator: getLogRecords_dict -> get_log_records_arg_dict
  * Add get_and_save() wrapper for MNRead.get()
    * This is a convenience method added because correctly saving the result from get() to a file is a bit tricky, while it is also the most common use of get().
  * Add option to create missing directories for MNRead.get_and_save()
  * Add description on how to use stream=True with MNRead.get()

* DataONE Common Library
  * Add module for handling obsolescence chains / revisions
    * `d1_common/revision.py`
  * Rename methods for creating missing directory names
    * `d1_common/util.py`
  * Add default page size of 100 records for getLogRecords()
    * `d1_common/const.py`
  * Update default User-Agent to DataONE_Python/x.y.z +http://dataone.org/
  * Add misc type related utilities to d1_common
    * `d1_common/type_conversions.py`, etc.

* Tests and test framework
  * Add section in README.md about db fixtures for GMN, how they're used, how to generate them
    * Improve procedure for regenerating db fixture
  * Add mock API handlers
    * MNCore.getCapabilities()
    * CNCore.listNodes()
  * Fix bug: SID did not resolve correctly
    * Add tests for SID resolve
  * Add handling of db where migrations are out of sync in fixture generator
  * Add script that checks scimeta indexing

* Misc
  * Update dependencies to current as of 2017-08-07
