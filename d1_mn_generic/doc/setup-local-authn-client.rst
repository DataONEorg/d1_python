Install non-trusted client side certificate
===========================================

In addition to acting as servers in the DataONE infrastructure, Member Nodes
also act as clients, initiating connections to other Nodes. When connecting to
other Nodes, Member Nodes authenticate themselves in a process called
:term:`client side authentication`, in which a client side certificate is
provided over an LTS/SSL connection.

Nodes that are registered with DataONE will only trust Member Node connections
where a client side sertificate issued by the DataONE :term:`CA` is provided.
However, a stand-alone instance of GMN will not connect to registered Member
Nodes, so a non-trusted client side certificate can be used instead.

These instructions use a non-trusted client side certificate for the first part
of the install and describe how to upgrade the certificate to a certificate
issued by the DataONE CA in the optional section on how to register the node.

If you already have a client side certificate issued by the DataONE CA, you can
still install the non-trusted certificate here and just follow the instructions
to upgrade it later.

  Copy the previously created locally signed client side certificate for
  outgoing connections::

    $ cd /var/local/dataone/certs/local_ca
    $ sudo mkdir -p ../client
    $ sudo cp client_cert.pem private/client_key_nopassword.pem ../client
