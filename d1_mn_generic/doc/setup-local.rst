Local installation
==================

This section describes the initial steps in setting up :term:`GMN`. If only this
section is completed, the resulting installation is a stand-alone test instance
of GMN. The stand-alone instance can be used for performance testing, developing
scripts for populating the MN and for learning about MNs in general.

By completing :doc:`setup-env`, the stand-alone test instance can then be
joined to DataONE as an official Member Node.
