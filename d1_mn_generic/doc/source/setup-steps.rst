Setup steps
===========

The GMN setup process has been broken down into a series of steps. Perform
the steps in order to set up a working instance of GMN.

Along with the steps, some background information is provided. The actual steps
that need to be performed are indented to separate them from the background
information.

Commands that need to be run from the shell are prefixed with "$" or "#". "$"
specifies that the command can be run as a regular user, while "#" specifies
that it must be run as root.

Use the link called `Next` in the sidebar to get to the next page of steps
after completing the current page.
