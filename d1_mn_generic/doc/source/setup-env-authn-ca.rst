Install CILogon and DataONE root CA certificates
================================================

For a client side certificate to be considered valid by GMN, GMN must trust the
CA that signed the client side certificate. This step sets up the CAs to be
trusted.

Two basic types of client side certificates are used in the DataONE
infrastructure. The first type is issued by the :term:`CILogon` CA and is used
for authenticating users. The second type is issued by the DataONE CA and is
used for authenticating Nodes.

CILogon is the identity provider for DataONE. CILogon provides three
:term:`LOA`\ s. These instructions set GMN up to accept all three.

DataONE issues certificates that let Nodes communite securely in the DataONE
infrastructure. The DataONE :term:`CA` root certificates must be trusted by all
Nodes.

The OS typically comes with a complete set of commonly trusted CA root
certificates. However, DataONE Nodes should not accept certificates signed by
these, so a separate CA store is used for the CILogon and DataONE root CAs.

Two separate certificate chains are available. One is used for the DataONE
production environment and one is used for all the testing and development
environments. Only the DataONE CA differs between the chains.

  Create a folder for the CA certificates::

    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/local/dataone/certs/ca

  Run **one** of the commands below, depending on which environment the MN is
  being registered into.

  Registering in a testing environment (Staging, Sandbox, Development)::

    # Only run this command when registering the MN in a testing environment
    $ sudo curl -o /var/local/dataone/certs/ca/cilogon_dataone_ca_chain.pem \
    https://repository.dataone.org/software/tools/trunk/ca/DataONETestCAChain.crt; \
    c_rehash /var/local/dataone/certs/ca/


  Registering in production::

    # Only run this command when registering the MN in production
    $ sudo curl -o /var/local/dataone/certs/ca/cilogon_dataone_ca_chain.pem \
    https://repository.dataone.org/software/tools/trunk/ca/DataONECAChain.crt; \
    c_rehash /var/local/dataone/certs/ca/
