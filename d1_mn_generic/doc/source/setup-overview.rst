GMN setup overview
==================

Overview of the GMN software stack
----------------------------------

.. include:: overview.rst

It may be possible to deploy GMN using a different stack, such as one based on
`nginx <http://nginx.net/>`_ and `uWSGI
<http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/wiki/>`_. Such setups are currently untested,
but if they are attempted and prove to have benefits, please let us know.
