Step 1: Hardware
================

Setting up the hardware.

GMN is installed on a physical or virtual machine. Network connectivity is
arranged so that GMN can be reached from the DataONE :term:`CN`\ s and from
:term:`client`\ s. Typically, this means that GMN is set up to be globally
accessible from the web.

If installed as an :term:`adapter <GMN>`, GMN must also be accessible from the
:term:`adaptee <GMN>` and be able to reach the adaptees storage facilities.

The requirements for RAM, CPU, disk and network resources are workload
dependent.
