The :doc:`/gmn/index` is a complete implementation of a DataONE Member Node
(:term:`MN`). It provides an implementation of all MN APIs and can be used by
organizations to expose their science data to DataONE if they do not wish to
create their own, native MN.

GMN can be used as a standalone MN or it can be used for exposing data that is
already available on the web, to DataONE. When used in this way, GMN provides a
DataONE compatible interface to existing data and does not store the data.

GMN can also be used as a workbone or reference for a 3rd party MN
implementation. If an organization wishes to donate storage space to DataONE,
GMN can be set up as a replication target.
