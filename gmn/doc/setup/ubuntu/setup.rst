Setup on Ubuntu
===============

This section describes the initial steps in setting up :term:`GMN`. The procedure has been verified on Server and Desktop versions of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Instructions for CentOS are :doc:`also available <../centos/setup>`.

Complete this section to set up a stand-alone test instance of GMN. The stand-alone instance can be used for performance testing, developing scripts for populating the MN and for learning about MNs in general.

The stand-alone test instance can then be joined to the DataONE production environment as an official Member Node or to one of DataONE's test environments for further testing by completing :doc:`../d1env/env`.
