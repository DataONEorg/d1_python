DataONE Type Bindings
=====================

DataONE services use XML messaging over HTTP as the primary means of communication between service nodes and clients. The XML messages are defined by XML Schema specifications and must be valid. d1_common_python provides binding classes for serialization of DataONE XML messages using implementations generated by the PyXB library.

PyXB generated classes are specific to the version of the schema and the version of PyXB installed. Hence, even though PyXB generated classes are provided with the distribution of ``d1_common_python``, it may be necessary to regenerate the classes depending on the particular version of PyXB installed.

The bash script ``d1_common/types/scripts/genbind`` will regenerate the binding classes. To regenerate binding classes::

  cd to the src folder of this distribution
  $ export D1COMMON_ROOT="$(pwd)"
  $ bash ${D1COMMON_ROOT}/d1_common/types/scripts/genbind
