The :doc:`/common/index` provides functionality commonly needed by clients,
servers and other applications that interact with the :term:`DataONE`
infrastructure via Python. This includes handling of the DataONE XML types,
X.509 v3 certificates with DataONE extension and Multipart documents as used by
DataONE.

This library forms the basis on which the higher level clients and servers in
:doc:`/client/index` are built. Before building directly on top of this library,
check if what you need is available there.
