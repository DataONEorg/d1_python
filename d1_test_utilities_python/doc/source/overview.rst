The `DataONE Test Utilities`_ package contains various utilities for testing
DataONE infrastructure components and clients. These include the
instance_generator, used for creating randomized System Metadata documents,
and the stress_tester, used for stress testing of Member Node
implementations. The stress_tester can create many concurrent connections to
a Member Node and simultaneously create any number of randomly generated objects
while running queries and object retrievals.
