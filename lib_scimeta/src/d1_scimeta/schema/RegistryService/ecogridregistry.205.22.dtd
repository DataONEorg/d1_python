  * This DTD describes the structure and content of XML documents used
  * to represent, store, and exchange a simple path-based query expression.
  * This syntax represents a small subset of the capabilities of the XPath 
  * language (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath), and is intended as a simple
  * query language for the metadata catalog database (mcdb).  It is 
  * intended that all expressions in this language can be mapped directly
  * into XPath syntax, but not all Xpath expressions can be mapped into this
  * syntax.
