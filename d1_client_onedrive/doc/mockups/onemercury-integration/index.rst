ONEMercury Integration
======================

Search/discovery for ONEDrive can be exposed in a web interface based on
ONEMercury. The interface would let users search for and discover objects. After
finding the objects, they would be accessed through ONEDrive.

Saving objects
---------------

* A single object can be added to user defined folders.

* The user can use the "New folder" option to a new folder and add the first
  object to it in the same operation.

* All of the search results can be added to a folder.

* It is also possible to add a function to create an RSS or Atom feed for the
  search results so that the user can be notified when new objects that match
  the search parameters are added to DataONE.
