`DataONE ONEDrive`_ enables the DataONE :term:`Workspace` to be accessed like a
regular filesystem on Windows, Linux and OS X systems. This allows users to open
remote DataONE objects locally and work with them as if they reside on the
user's computer. For instance, a spread sheet that is stored on a Member Node
can be opened directly in Excel.
