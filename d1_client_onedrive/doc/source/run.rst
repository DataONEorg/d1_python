Using ONEDrive
==============

The default settings for ONEDrive are in the ``settings.py`` file that resides
in the same location as the ``onedrive.py`` script. To modify the default
settings, edit ``settings.py``.

To launch ONEDrive with the default settings, simply start ONEDrive. See the
OS specific sections below for how to start ONEDrive on your computer.

Most of the defaults can be overridden at launch time by adding options on the
command line. The options are listed below, together with their default values
(from ``settings.py``)::

  Usage: onedrive.py [options]

  Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --version         Display version information and exit

Zotero Library Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ONEDrive uses the `Zotero citation manager`_ as an online repository of
references to DataONE objects. As DataONE objects are added to a Zotero library
via the ONEMercury search tool or any other method supported by Zotero, they
become available as files in the ONEDrive filesystem. The files can then be
opened directly in applications running on your own computer.

ONEDrive shows up in your computer as an extra storage device, much like a CD
drive or a USB flash drive. Like your regular storage devices, ONEDrive contains
folders that can contain files or other folders. The folders represent
collections in Zotero. To make DataONE objects appear in a given folder in
ONEDrive, add them to the corresponding collection in Zotero.

Folders can contain objects that have been specified directly and search queries
that can specify any number of objects. Search queries are dynamically resolved
to their matching DataONE objects and those objects become available within the
ONEDrive filesystem, in the same folder in which the search query is stored.

ONEDrive recognizes DataONE objects in the Zotery library by their URLs. Zotero
library items that have URLs that reference the DataONE Coordinating Node
resolve endpoint at ``https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/resolve/<identifier>`` appear
directly as DataONE objects. Library items that have URLs that reference the
query endpoint at ``https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v1/query/solr/<query>`` will cause
the queries to be executed on the Coordinating Node and the resulting DataONE
objects will appear in the ONEDrive filesystem.


Notes
~~~~~

ONEDrive checks for updates in the Zotery library each time it is started. If
the library has been updated, ONEDrive will refresh its local cache of the
Zotero library and the metadata for the DataONE objects exposed through the
filesystem.

Zotero can have multiple root level collections while a filesystem can have only
one root. ONEDrive handles this by adding an additional level, so that root
level collections in Zotero are the first level directories in the filesystem
root.

Items in the Zotero library don't have to be in a collection. Any objects not in
a collection are displayed in the root of the filesystem.

The folders in the ONEDrive filesystem contain readme files that describe the
contents of the folders.

Because the DataONE API currently does not specify a way for Member Nodes to
allow partial downloads of objects, ONEDrive downloads the entire object the
first time it is accessed through the filesystem. If the object is large, the
filesystem will appear to freeze while this download is being performed in the
background. When the entire object has been downloaded to ONEDrive's cache, the
filesystem becomes responsive again. ONEDrive caches objects across runs, so
this will only happen the first time an object is accessed.


FlatSpace
~~~~~~~~~

In the root of the ONEDrive filesystem, there are two folders, FlatSpace and
ObjectTree. ObjectTree exposes the Zotero based functionality described above.
FlatSpace exposes functionality that allows DataONE objects to be accessed
without first having to add them to the Zotero library. To access objects
directly through FlatSpace, simple type the object identifier at the end of
the filesystem path after entering the FlatSpace folder.

After an object has been accessed through FlatSpace, ONEDrive will start
rendering a folder for the object in FlatSpace so that the identifier does not
have to be typed the next time the object is accessed. ONEDrive caches this
information across runs.
