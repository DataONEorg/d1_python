:doc:`/onedrive/index` enables DataONE objects stored in `Zotero citation
manager`_ libraries to be accessed like regular files on Windows, Mac OS X and
Linux systems. This allows users to open remote DataONE objects locally and work
with them as if they reside on the user's computer. For instance, a spread sheet
that is stored on a Member Node can be opened directly in Excel.

DataONE objects can be added to a Zotero library via the ONEMercury search tool.
Objects can also be added in all the other ways that Zotero supports. ONEDrive
connects to a Zotero library and makes all DataONE objects within the library
accessible as regular files. Zotero collections are represented as folders in
the ONEDrive filesystem.
