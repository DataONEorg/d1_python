Updating the library
====================

To update your copy of the library to the latest version available on PyPI, run ``pip install`` with the ``--upgrade`` option:

::

  $ sudo pip install --upgrade dataone.common

It may also be necessary to regenerate the DataONE type bindings after an update. See Types_ for more information.
